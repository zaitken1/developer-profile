# My Developer Portfolio

## Description

This webpage acts as my developer portfolio, to demonstrate my completed web projects and the skills that I have learnt and applied during my front-end developer bootcamp course. I will use this website to showcase my strongest work to potential employers. It also enables me to keep all of my deployed web applications in a central online location.

So far, I have learnt and applied the following skills to this web application:

* Flexbox
* CSS Grid
* Media queries

I have used the above skills to add the following features to this website:

* Responsive navigation bar with anchor links to sections of the page
* A recent image of myself along with an 'about me' section and contact details
* Media queries to make this website responsive to a wide range of screen sizes and devices
* Grid display with links and images of my completed projects that make up my current portfolio
* Flexbox for positioning elements and content easily
* Semantic HTML elements to ensure accessibility

I will continue to add completed web application projects to this portfolio over time.
